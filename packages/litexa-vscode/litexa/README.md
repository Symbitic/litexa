# Litexa

Language support for the Litexa skill writing
language, usually contained in text files identified
by the extension .litexa

## Installation

To install this extension, either copy it into your
`.vscode/extensions directory`, or better yet, create a
symlink from this location to a subdirectory there.

See [the VS Code documentation about installing an extension locally.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-hello-world#_installing-your-extension-locally)

Once visible at that location, you can reload your
VS Code window to see syntax highlighting appear for
`.litexa` files.

## Features

* Simple syntax highlighting

## Future plans

* Document Outline: jump to states and intent handlers
* Jump to state: highlight a state, hit jump and get
taken to the definition

## Requirements

This is intended to work hand in hand with the litexa package.

## Release Notes
